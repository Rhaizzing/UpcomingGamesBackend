# Upcoming Games Backend

Upcoming Games is a small project aimed to provide an API where a user can add upcoming games to watch for their releases. The API can be consumed in a number of ways, from Discord bots to [frontends](https://github.com/Rhaizzing/UpcomingGamesFrontend). All the data comes from IGDB, so it's probably very accurate and up-to-date.

# Technical Info

The project is made in C#, with .NET 6, the database is PostgreSQL 14. The code is using a layered architecture to separate and reutilize the code.

# How to run

The project can be run using `dotnet run` inside the `UpcomingGames.API` folder
